Project Details


	•	Password stored in Google Sheets
	•	Login validated against the Sheet (works across all devices)
	•	Duplicate check on registration
	•	Attendance recorded on every login

Google Sheets Setup:

Tables: Timestamp | First Name | Last Name | Email | Transaction ID | Password | Type

"Type” will be “Registered” or “Login” for clarity.


This system finally will:
	•	Prevents duplicate accounts
	•	Supports login from any device
	•	Stores password in Google Sheets (plaintext — good for internal systems)
	•	Logs every attendance on login
